                    <p>Autobiography</p>
                    <p>I am Timothy Josef A. Reyes and I am a BS Computer Science major! I am currently a second year student and have learned quite a lot about coding. I was born in Bi√±an, Laguna but I currently live in Santa Rosa, ALguna with my family. I would say that my favorite coding language is Python due to its ease of use, but I still see the merit of learning lower-level languages to help in further understanding the ture essence of coding. My hobbies are playing games, sleeping, and eating. I got into Computer Science due to my interest in technology and my friends who are also tech enthusiasts</p>
